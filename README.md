This WordPress plugin allows you to disable any sidebar and dashboard widget for the current WordPress site you are on.

It provides a simple user interface available to users with `edit_theme_options` capabilities (usually Administrator role) available under Appearance -> Disable Widgets.

After saving the settings, the sidebar and dashboard widgets are removed and users canâ€™t use those widgets anymore.
